# timer
This repo shows how React lifecycle methods are used.
It's just a simple app that counts seconds;
There is a button that allows a user to start the count from a random number.
There is also a button to show or hide the count (that is, to unmount the component when hidden).
Otherwise, the counting is started from 0, and the updating interval is defined by the componentDidMount method.
The example is taken from Sebastian Springer's book "React: Das umfassende Handbuch", Rheinwerk Verlag, Bonn 2020. The sample is found in chapter 4.
